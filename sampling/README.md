## Spatial Sampling

To estimate the solar rooftop potential for the whole city 2 spatial sampling methods are used:

1. Simple Random Spatial Sampling
2. Stratified Random Spatial Sampling

The R Markdown code ```laplata_sampling.Rmd``` describes the sampling process for the city of La Plata.  
The data can be found in the ```data``` folder and was created in [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/).  
The output of the analysis can be found [here](https://bookdown.org/einavg7/laplata_sampling/laplata_sampling.html).
